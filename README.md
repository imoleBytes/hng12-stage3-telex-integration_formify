Formify is a seamless Form as a Service (FaaS) tool that empowers users to collect and manage form data without the need for a backend infrastructure. With Formify, users can simply embed a URL into the "action" attribute of an HTML form, and the submitted data will be automatically processed and sent to a designated Telex channel.
